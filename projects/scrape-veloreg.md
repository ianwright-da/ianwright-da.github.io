I am an avid cyclist and race competitively. I am also lucky enough to live within commuting distance of the two oldest functioning velodromes in the United States, the [Ed Rudolph Velodrome](https://www.northbrookcyclecommittee.org/) in Northbrook, IL and the [Washington Park Velodrome](https://www.kenoshavelodromeracing.com/) in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The two tracks now share an online registration and results system, and in this project I write a scripts to scrape results from the system, clean the results, and develop a performance metric to represent rider quality. The resulting metric takes into account a rider's success over time and the quality of their competitors, and informs an overall rider ranking that closely matches rider performance. 

Below are links to notebooks containing the three stages of the process and commentary.
